# Parts and Labor

A sass library of utilities and grid systems.

## Parts

Grid layout systems:

- **Standard Grid** floats columns, modeled after the old ways of Bourbon 4.x
-- Options for gutter widths to be fluid or strict
- **Flex Grid** creates columns using flexbox

## Labor

Utilties that assist with layout, basic styling, and more. From positioning (like `@mixin center`) to background images (`@mixin bkg-img`) to list styling (`@mixin list-inline`), the library aims to help take care of typical needs.

## Documentation

## Output: Zero

This library does not output any css. It is purely a library of utilities and mixins for you to use in your sass projects.
